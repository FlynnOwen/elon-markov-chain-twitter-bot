<h2 align="center"> What is it? </h2>
<p align="center"> 
  Upon running of the lambda function (markov_tweet.py), all Elon Musks Tweets are scraped, cleaned and concatenated with a large dataset of childrens books. 
  
  From here, a first order Markov Chain is generated, and words are recursively generated from this Markov Chain until either the Twitter word limit or a sentence conclusion is reached.
